# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

----
## Project Overview

In this project, I explored the Mall_Customers.csv dataset with the main focus on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The goal was to identify distinct customer groups based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

Through this analysis, I learned how K-Means clustering groups similar customers into distinct clusters, how to interpret cluster centroids to understand segment characteristics, and how to determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. I also gained insights into different customer behaviors that could be useful for targeted marketing and business decision-making.

Dataset

The dataset contains 200 entries with the following columns:

  - **CustomerID** ‚Äì Unique ID for each customer

  - **Gender** ‚Äì Male or Female

  - **Age** ‚Äì Age of the customer

  - **Annual Income (k$)** ‚Äì Customer‚Äôs annual income in thousands

  - **Spending Score (1-100)** ‚Äì Score representing spending behavior

  - **Shape:** (200, 5)

## What I Did in This Project

**1. Data Exploration**

  - Explored the dataset for missing values and understood the distribution of features.

  - Visualized Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score to identify patterns and potential clusters.

  - Learned how feature distributions can influence clustering results in K-Means.

**2. Preprocessing**

  - Encoded the Gender column to numerical values for analysis.

  - Prepared the data to ensure fair clustering and avoid bias due to scale differences.

  - Learned that proper preprocessing improves the quality and interpretability of K-Means clusters.

**3. K-Means Clustering**

  - Applied K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments.

  - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and learned why selecting the right k is crucial for meaningful segmentation.

  - Interpreted cluster centroids to understand the typical profile of each customer group, including income levels and spending behavior.

  - Learned that K-Means clusters can reveal hidden structures in customer data that are not obvious from raw features alone.

## Key Insights

From the clustering analysis, I observed:

  - Clear separation of customer groups based on spending behavior and income.

  - High-income, high-spending customers, and low-income, low-spending customers form distinct clusters.

  - Cluster centroids helped summarize the characteristics of each segment and identify potential target groups.

  - Learned that K-Means is a powerful tool to discover hidden patterns and similarities among customers that can drive marketing strategies or business decisions.
